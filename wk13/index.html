<h2>12.05 Module Review</h2>
    <h3>12.05a Module Summary</h3>
    - Change is inevitable, so organizations should have procedures to deal with changes in the operation and maintenance of the information security program.
    - The CISO decides whether the information security program can adapt to change as it is implemented or whether the process of the risk management program must be started anew.
    - To stay current, the information security community of interest and the CISO must constantly monitor the three components of the security triple—threats, assets, and vulnerabilities.
    - To assist the information security community in managing and operating the ongoing security program, the organization should adopt a security management maintenance model. These models are frameworks that are structured by the tasks of managing a particular set of activities or business functions.
    - NIST SP 800-100, “Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers,” outlines managerial tasks performed after the program is operational. For each of the 13 areas of information security management presented in SP 800-100, there are specific monitoring activities:
        - Information security governance
        - Systems development life cycle
        - Awareness and training
        - Capital planning and investment control
        - Interconnecting systems
        - Performance measures
        - Security planning
        - Information technology contingency planning
        - Risk management
        - Certification, accreditation, and security assessments
        - Security services and products acquisition
        - Incident response
        - Configuration and change management
    - The maintenance model recommended in this module is made up of five subject areas or domains: external monitoring, internal monitoring, planning and risk assessment, vulnerability assessment and remediation, and readiness and review.
    - The objective of the external monitoring domain in the maintenance model is to provide early awareness of new and emerging threats, threat agents, vulnerabilities, and attacks so that an effective and timely defense can be mounted.
    - The objective of the internal monitoring domain is an informed awareness of the state of the organization’s networks, information systems, and information security defenses. The security team documents and communicates this awareness, particularly when it concerns system components that face the external network.
    - The primary objective of the planning and risk assessment domain is to keep an eye on the entire information security program.
    - The primary objectives of the vulnerability assessment and remediation domain are to identify specific, documented vulnerabilities and remediate them in a timely fashion.
    - The primary objectives of the readiness and review domain are to keep the information security program functioning as designed and keep improving it over time.
    - Physical security requires the design, implementation, and maintenance of countermeasures that protect the physical resources of an organization.
    - An organization’s policy should guide the planning for physical security throughout the development life cycle.
    - In facilities management, a secure facility is a physical location that has controls to minimize the risk of attacks from physical threats. A secure facility can use natural terrain, traffic flow, and urban development, and can complement these environmental elements with protection mechanisms such as fences, gates, walls, guards, and alarms.
    - The management of keys and locks is a fundamental part of general management’s responsibility for the organization’s physical environment.
    - A fail-safe lock is typically used on an exit door when human safety in a fire or other emergency is the essential consideration. A fail-secure lock is used when human safety is not the dominant factor.
    - Fire suppression systems typically work by denying an environment one of the three requirements for a fire to burn: temperature (an ignition source), fuel, and oxygen.
    - Four environmental variables controlled by HVAC systems can cause damage to information systems: temperature, filtration, humidity, and static electricity.
    - Computer systems depend on stable power supplies to function; when power levels are too high, too low, or too erratic, computer circuitry can be damaged or destroyed. The power provided to computing and networking equipment should contain no unwanted fluctuations and no embedded signaling.
    - As with any phase of the security process, the implementation of physical security must be constantly documented, evaluated, and tested. Once the physical security of a facility is established, it must be diligently maintained.
    - Data can be intercepted electronically and manually. The three routes of data interception are direct observation, interception of data transmission, and interception of electromagnetic radiation.
    - With the increased use of laptops, tablets, and smartphones, organizations should be aware that mobile computing requires even more security than the average in-house system.
    - Remote site computing requires a secure extension of the organization’s internal networks and special attention to security for any connected home or off-site computing technology.
