<h2>07.07 Chapter Review</h2>
    <h3>07.07a Module Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Where to place the information security function within the organization is a key decision. The most popular options involve placing information security within IT or the physical security function. Organizations searching for a rational compromise should place the information security function where it can balance its need to enforce company policy with its need to deliver service to the entire organization.</li>
        <li>The selection of information security personnel is based on several criteria, not all of which are within the control of the organization. In most cases, organizations look for a technically qualified information security generalist with a solid understanding of how an organization operates. The following attributes are also desirable:
            - an attitude that infosec is usually a management problem, not an exclusively technical problem
            - good people skills, communication skills, writing skills, and a tolerance for users
            - an understanding of the role of policy in guiding security efforts
            - an understanding of the role of education and training in making users part of the solution
            - an understanding of the threats an organization, how they can become attacks, and how to protect the organization from information security attacks
            - a working knowledge of many common technologies and a general familiarity with most mainstream IT technologies</li>
        <li>Many information security professionals enter the field through one of two career paths: via law enforcement or the military, or from other professions related to technical information systems. In recent years, college students have been able to take courses that prepare them to enter the information security workforce directly.</li>    
        <li>During the hiring process for an information security position, an organization should use standard job descriptions to increase the degree of professionalism among applicants and to make sure the position’s roles and responsibilities are consistent with those of similar positions in other organizations. Studies of information security positions have found that they can be classified into one of three areas: those that define, those that build, and those that administer.</li>
        <li>When filling information security positions, many organizations indicate the level of proficiency required for the job by specifying that candidates have recognizable certifications. Some of the more popular certifications are the following:
            - The  family of certifications, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), a number of specialized CISSP certifications, the Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP), the Associate of , and several other specialized certifications
            - The ISACA family of certifications, including the Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), and several other specialized certifications
            - The Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) family of certifications, including the GIAC Information Security Professional and the GIAC Security Leadership Certification
            - CompTIA’s Security+ and EC-Council’s CCISO</li>
        <li>The general management community of interest should integrate information security concepts into the organization’s employment policies and practices. Areas in which information security should be a consideration include employment contracts, new hire orientation, performance evaluation, termination, and hiring. The hiring process includes job descriptions, interviews, and background checks.</li>
        <li>Separation of duties is a control used to reduce the chance of any person violating information security and breaching the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information. According to the principle behind this control, any major task that involves sensitive information should require two people to complete.</li>    
        <li>Organizations may need the special services of temporary employees, contract employees, consultants, and business partners, but these relationships should be carefully managed to prevent information leaks or theft.</li>
    </ul>
