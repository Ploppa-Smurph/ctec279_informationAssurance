<h2>10.02 Encryption Methods</h2>
<b>bit stream</b> - use algorithm functions like XOR (exclusive OR operation); encrypted 1 bit at a time
<b>block stream</b> - encrypted blocks at a time (8, 16, 32, or 64 blocks at a time); uses substitution, transposition, XOR, or other combinations of substitution operations
<b>Cipher Notation</b>
<b><i>E(M) = C </i></b>; Encryption (E) is applied to a message (M) to create cipertext (C)
<b><i>D[C] = D[E(M)] </i></b>; by decrypting (D) and encrypted message [E(M)] it results in the original message (M)
<b><i>E(M,K) = C </i></b>; Encrypting (E) the message (M) with key (K) results in the ciphertext (C). If more than one key (K) is ussed in a multiple-round encryption, the keys are numbered K1, K2, and so on
<b><i>D(C,K) = D[E(M,K),K] = M</i></b>; decrypting the ciphertext with the key (K) results in the original plaintext message.

<h2>10.06 Module Review</h2>
    <h3>10.06a Module Summary</h3>
    - Encryption is the process of converting a message into a form that is unreadable to unauthorized people.
    - The science of encryption, known as cryptology, encompasses cryptography (making and using encryption codes) and cryptanalysis (breaking encryption codes).
    - Cryptology has a long history and continues to change and improve.
    - Two basic processing methods are used to convert plaintext data into encrypted data—bit stream and block ciphering. The other major methods used for scrambling data include substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, the XOR function, the Vigenère cipher, and the Vernam cipher.
    - Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that generate a message summary, or digest, that can be used to confirm the identity of a specific message and confirm that the message has not been altered.
    - Most cryptographic algorithms can be grouped into two broad categories: symmetric and asymmetric. In practice, most popular cryptosystems are hybrids that combine symmetric and asymmetric algorithms.
    - The strength of many encryption applications and cryptosystems is determined by key size. All other things being equal, the length of the key directly affects the strength of the encryption.
    - Public key infrastructure (PKI) is an integrated system of software, encryption methodologies, protocols, legal agreements, and third-party services that enables users to communicate securely. PKI includes digital certificates and certificate authorities.
    - Digital signatures are encrypted messages that are independently verified by a central facility and provide nonrepudiation. A digital certificate is an electronic document, similar to a digital signature, which is attached to a file to certify it came from the organization that claims to have sent it and was not modified from its original format.
    - Steganography is the hiding of information. It is not technically a form of cryptography, but is similar in that it protects confidential information while in transit.
    - Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Electronic Transactions (SET), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are protocols designed to enable secure communications across the Internet. IPSec is the protocol used to secure communications across any IP-based network, such as LANs, WANs, and the Internet. Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM), and Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) are protocols that are used to secure electronic mail. PGP is a hybrid cryptosystem that combines some of the best available cryptographic algorithms; it has become the open-source de facto standard for encryption and authentication of e-mail and file storage applications.
    - Wireless networks require their own cryptographic protection. Originally protected with WEP and WPA, most modern Wi-Fi networks are now protected with WPA2. Bluetooth—a short-range wireless protocol used predominantly for wireless phones and PDAs—can be exploited by anyone within its 30-foot range.
