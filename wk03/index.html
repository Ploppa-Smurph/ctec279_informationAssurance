<h1>02 The Need for Security</h1>
<ul><b>Learning Objectives</b>
    <li>Discuss organizational need for information security</li>
    <li>Explain why a successful information security program is the shared responsibility of an organization's three communities of interest</li>
    <li>List and describe the threats posed to information security and common attacks associated with those threats</li>
    <li>List the common development failures and errors that result from poor software security efforts</li>
</ul>
<h2>02.01 Introduction</h2>
<h3>02.01a Business Needs First</h3>
    InfoSec provides 4 important functions for a business
     - Protect organization's ability to function
     - Protect data and information the organization collects and uses
     - Enabling the safe operation of applications running on the organization's IT system
     - Safeguarding the organization's technology assets

    <b>Protecting Functionality</b>
        3 Communities of Interest = General Management, IT Management, and Information Security Management
           - General Managment and IT are responsible for facilitating a security program
           - Implementing information security has more to do with management than technology
           - Communities of interest should address information security in terms of business impact and cost of business interruption.
            
    <b>Protecting Data That Organizations Collect and Use</b>
        Must Protect Data at rest (stored), in transit, and during processing

    <b>Enabling the Safe Operation of Application</b>
        Establish environment that safeguards applications using the IT system. 

        Management must continue to oversee infrastructure - cannot relegate it to the IT department

    <b>Safeguarding Technology Assets in Organization</b>
        
<h2>02.02 Information Security Threats and Attacks</h2>
    <b>Threat</b>    - potential risk to asset's loss of value
    <b>Attack</b>    - intentional, or unintentional, act tha can damage or otherwise compromise information and the systems that support it

<h2>02.04 Module Review</h2>
<h3>02.04a Module Summary</h3>
    - Information security performs four important functions to ensure that information assets remain safe and useful: protecting the organization’s ability to function, enabling the safe operation of applications implemented on the organization’s IT systems, protecting the data an organization collects and uses, and safeguarding the organization’s technology assets.

    - To make sound decisions about information security, management must be informed about threats to its people, applications, data, and information systems, and the attacks they face.
    
    - Threats are any events or circumstances that have the potential to adversely affect operations and assets. An attack is an intentional or unintentional act that can damage or otherwise compromise information and the systems that support it. A vulnerability is a potential weakness in an asset or its defensive controls.
    
    - Threats or dangers facing an organization’s people, information, and systems fall into the following categories:
    
        - Compromises to intellectual property—Intellectual property, such as trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, or patents, are intangible assets that may be attacked via software piracy or the exploitation of asset protection controls.
    
        - Deviations in quality of service—Organizations rely on services provided by others. Losses can come from interruptions to those services.
    
        - Espionage or trespass—Asset losses may result when electronic and human activities breach the confidentiality of information.
    
        - Forces of nature—A wide range of natural events can overwhelm control systems and preparations to cause losses to data and availability.
    
        - Human error or failure—Losses to assets may come from intentional or accidental actions by people inside and outside the organization.
    
        - Information extortion—Stolen or inactivated assets may be held hostage to extract payment of ransom.
    
        - Sabotage or vandalism—Losses may result from the deliberate sabotage of a computer system or business, or from acts of vandalism. These acts can either destroy an asset or damage the image of an organization.
    
        - Software attacks—Losses may result when attackers use software to gain unauthorized access to systems or cause disruptions in systems availability.
    
        - Technical hardware failures or errors—Technical defects in hardware systems can cause unexpected results, including unreliable service or lack of availability.
    
        - Technical software failures or errors—Software used by systems may have purposeful or unintentional errors that result in failures, which can lead to loss of availability or unauthorized access to information.
    
        - Technological obsolescence—Antiquated or outdated infrastructure can lead to unreliable and untrustworthy systems that may result in loss of availability or unauthorized access to information.
    
        - Theft—Theft of information can result from a wide variety of attacks.

<h3>02.04c Exercises</h3>
01) Consider that an individual threat agent, like a hacker, can be a factor in more than one threat category. If a hacker breaks into a network, copies a few files, defaces a Web page, and steals credit card numbers, how many different threat categories does the attack fall into?

02) Using the Web, research Mafiaboy’s exploits. When and how did he compromise sites? How was he caught?

03) Search the Web for “The Official Phreaker’s Manual.” What information in this manual might help a security administrator to protect a communications system?

04) This module discussed many threats and vulnerabilities to information security. Using the Web, find at least two other sources of information about threats and vulnerabilities. Begin with www.securityfocus.com and use a keyword search on “threats.”

05) Using the categories of threats mentioned in this module and the various attacks described, review several current media sources and identify examples of each threat.

<h3>02.04d Security for Life</h3>
 
Module 2 of Principles of Information Security examines the business drivers behind the security analysis design process. It examines current needs for security in organizations and technology. One principal concept is that information security is primarily an issue of management, not technology. Best practices apply technology only after considering the business needs.

The module also examines the various threats facing organizations and presents the process of ranking these threats to provide relative priority as the organization begins the security planning process. The module continues with a detailed examination of the types of attacks that could occur from these threats and discusses how they could impact the organization’s information and systems. The chapter concludes with a discussion of development failures and errors that result from poor software security efforts.

<ul>There are twelve categories of threats:
<li>Compromises to intellectual property</li>
<li>Deviations in quality of service</li>
<li>Espionage or trespass</li>
<li>Forces of nature</li>
<li>Human error or failure</li>
<li>Information extortion</li>
<li>Sabotage or vandalism</li>
<li>Software attacks</li>
<li>Technical hardware failures or errors</li>
<li>Technological obsolescence</li>
<li>Theft</li>
</ul>
