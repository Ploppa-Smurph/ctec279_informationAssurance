<h1>02 The Need for Security</h1>
<ul><b>Learning Objectives</b>
    <li>Discuss organizational need for information security</li>
    <li>Explain why a successful information security program is the shared responsibility of an organization's three communities of interest</li>
    <li>List and describe the threats posed to information security and common attacks associated with those threats</li>
    <li>List the common development failures and errors that result from poor software security efforts</li>
</ul>
<h2>02.01 Introduction</h2>
<h3>02.01a Business Needs First</h3>
    InfoSec provides 4 important functions for a business
     - Protect organization's ability to function
     - Protect data and information the organization collects and uses
     - Enabling the safe operation of applications running on the organization's IT system
     - Safeguarding the organization's technology assets

    <b>Protecting Functionality</b>
        3 Communities of Interest = General Management, IT Management, and Information Security Management
    <b>Protecting Data That Organizations Collect and Use</b>
    <b>Enabling the Safe Operation of Application</b>
    <b>Safeguarding Technology Assets in Organization</b>

<h3>02.04c Exercises</h3>
01) Consider that an individual threat agent, like a hacker, can be a factor in more than one threat category. If a hacker breaks into a network, copies a few files, defaces a Web page, and steals credit card numbers, how many different threat categories does the attack fall into?

02) Using the Web, research Mafiaboy’s exploits. When and how did he compromise sites? How was he caught?

03) Search the Web for “The Official Phreaker’s Manual.” What information in this manual might help a security administrator to protect a communications system?

04) This module discussed many threats and vulnerabilities to information security. Using the Web, find at least two other sources of information about threats and vulnerabilities. Begin with www.securityfocus.com and use a keyword search on “threats.”

05) Using the categories of threats mentioned in this module and the various attacks described, review several current media sources and identify examples of each threat.

<h3>02.04d Security for Life</h3>
 
Module 2 of Principles of Information Security examines the business drivers behind the security analysis design process. It examines current needs for security in organizations and technology. One principal concept is that information security is primarily an issue of management, not technology. Best practices apply technology only after considering the business needs.

The module also examines the various threats facing organizations and presents the process of ranking these threats to provide relative priority as the organization begins the security planning process. The module continues with a detailed examination of the types of attacks that could occur from these threats and discusses how they could impact the organization’s information and systems. The chapter concludes with a discussion of development failures and errors that result from poor software security efforts.

<ul>There are twelve categories of threats:
<li>Compromises to intellectual property</li>
<li>Deviations in quality of service</li>
<li>Espionage or trespass</li>
<li>Forces of nature</li>
<li>Human error or failure</li>
<li>Information extortion</li>
<li>Sabotage or vandalism</li>
<li>Software attacks</li>
<li>Technical hardware failures or errors</li>
<li>Technological obsolescence</li>
<li>Theft</li>
</ul>
Go to the discussion board in your school’s LMS (learning management system). If there are any posts from your fellow students about one of the threats, review the posts quickly.
Review the examples listed above and select one threat that you would like to learn more about. If possible, avoid what your fellow students have already covered in their posts to the LMS. You can use the following web sites, among others, to conduct your research:
jissec.org
etutorials.org: Categories of Threats
After choosing your threat of interest, identify two attack examples. You can address the following questions to help you describe your examples:
How do the examples fit with the type of threat that you identified?
How do the examples represent a clear and present danger to the organization?
Post a summary of your findings in the LMS, using a minimum of 200 words. Remember, try to make sure that your topic was not chosen by a majority of your classmates.
Answer the relevant questions posed above in paragraph format and include any other interesting information as desired.
Use complete sentences and check your grammar and spelling.
Comment on one of your classmates’ postings that does not have comments yet. Give your critique of their post and quickly summarize what you learned from it.
Use a minimum of 50 words in your comment.
