<h2>05.09 Module Review</h2>
    <h3>05.09a Module Summary</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Planning for unexpected events is usually the responsibility of general business managers and the information technology and information security communities of interest.</li>
    <li>For a plan to be seen as valid by all members of the organization, it must be sanctioned and actively supported by the general business community of interest.</li>
    <li>Some organizations are required by law or other mandate to have contingency planning procedures in place at all times, but all business organizations should prepare for the unexpected.</li>
    <li>Contingency planning (CP) is the process by which the information technology and information security communities of interest position their organizations to prepare for, detect, react to, and recover from events that threaten the security of information resources and assets.</li>
    <li>CP is made up of four major components: the data collection and documentation process known as the business impact analysis (BIA), the incident response (IR) plan, the disaster recovery (DR) plan, and the business continuity (BC) plan.</li>
    <li>Organizations can either create and develop the four planning elements of the CP process as one unified plan, or they can create these elements separately in conjunction with a set of interlocking procedures that enable continuity.</li>
    <li>To ensure continuity during the creation of the CP components, a seven-step CP process is used:
    <ol>
        <li>Develop the contingency planning policy statement.</li>
        <li>Conduct the BIA.</li>
        <li>Identify preventive controls.</li>
        <li>Create contingency strategies.</li>
        <li>Develop a contingency plan.</li>
        <li>Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises.</li>
        <li>Ensure plan maintenance.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Four teams are involved in contingency planning and contingency operations: the CP team, the IR team, the DR team, and the BC team. The IR team ensures that the CSIRT is formed.</li>
    <li>The IR plan is a detailed set of processes and procedures that plan for, detect, and resolve the effects of an unexpected event on information resources and assets.</li>
    <li>For every scenario identified, the CP team creates three sets of procedures—for before, during, and after the incident—to detect, contain, and resolve the incident.</li>
    <li>Incident classification is the process by which the IR team examines an incident candidate and determines whether it constitutes an actual incident.</li>
    <li>Three categories of incident indicators are used: possible, probable, and definite.</li>
    <li>When any one of the following happens, an actual incident is in progress: loss of availability of information, loss of integrity of information, loss of confidentiality of information, violation of policy, or violation of law.</li>
    <li>Digital forensics is the investigation of wrongdoing in the arena of information security. Digital forensics requires the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation, and interpretation of computer media for evidentiary and root cause analysis.</li>
    <li>DR planning encompasses preparation for handling and recovering from a disaster, whether natural or human-made.</li>

BC planning ensures that critical business functions continue if a catastrophic incident or disaster occurs. BC plans can include provisions for hot sites, warm sites, cold sites, timeshares, service bureaus, and mutual agreements.

Because the DR and BC plans are closely related, most organizations prepare the two at the same time and may combine them into a single planning document called the business resumption (BR) plan.

The DR plan should include crisis management, the action steps taken during and after a disaster. In some cases, the protection of human life and the organization’s image are such high priorities that crisis management may deserve its own policy and plan.

All plans must be tested to identify vulnerabilities, faults, and inefficient processes. Several strategies can be used to test contingency plans: desk checks, structured walk-throughs, simulations, and full interruption.
