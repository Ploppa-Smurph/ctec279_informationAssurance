<h2>09.04 Module Review</h2>
    <h3>09.04a Module Summary</h3>
    - Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) identify potential intrusions and sound an alarm. The more recently developed intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) also detect intrusions and can take action to defend the network.
    - An IDPS works like a burglar alarm by detecting network traffic that violates the system’s configured rules and activating an alarm.
    - A network-based IDPS (NIDPS) monitors network traffic and then notifies the appropriate administrator when a predefined event occurs. A host-based IDPS (HIDPS) resides on a particular computer or server and monitors activity on that system.
    - Signature-based IDPSs, also known as knowledge-based IDPSs, examine data traffic for patterns that match signatures—preconfigured, predetermined attack patterns. Anomaly-based IDPSs, also known as behavior-based IDPSs, collect data from normal traffic and establish a baseline. When an activity is found to be outside the baseline parameters (or clipping level), these IDPSs activate an alarm to notify the administrator.
    - Selecting IDPS products that best fit an organization’s needs is a challenging and complex process. A wide array of products and vendors are available, each with different approaches and capabilities.
    - Deploying and implementing IDPS technology is a complex undertaking that requires knowledge and experience. After deployment, each organization should measure the effectiveness of its IDPS and then continue with periodic assessments over time.
    - Honeypots are decoy systems designed to lure potential attackers away from critical systems. In the security industry, these systems are also known as decoys, lures, or flytraps. Two variations on this technology are known as honeynets and padded cell systems.
    - Trap-and-trace applications are designed to react to an intrusion event by tracing it back to its source. This process is fraught with professional and ethical issues—some people in the security field believe that the back hack in the trace process is as significant a violation as the initial attack.
    - Active intrusion prevention seeks to limit the damage that attackers can perpetrate by making the local network resistant to inappropriate use.
    - Scanning and analysis tools are used to pinpoint vulnerabilities in systems, holes in security components, and unsecured aspects of the network. Although these tools are used by attackers, they can also be used by administrators to learn more about their own systems and to identify and repair system weaknesses before they result in losses.
