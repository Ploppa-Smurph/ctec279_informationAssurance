<h2>03.06 Module Review</h2>
<h3>03.06a Module Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Information security governance is the application of the principles of corporate governance to the information security function. These principles include executive management’s responsibility to provide strategic direction, ensure the accomplishment of objectives, oversee that risks are appropriately managed, and validate responsible resource use.</li>
<li>Management must use policies as the basis for all information security planning, design, and deployment. Policies direct how issues should be addressed and technologies should be used.</li>
<li>Standards are more detailed than policies and describe the steps that must be taken to conform to policies.</li>
<li>Management must define three types of security policies: general or security program policies, issue-specific security policies, and systems-specific security policies.</li>
<li>The enterprise information security policy (EISP) should be a driving force in the planning and governance activities of the organization as a whole.</li>
<li>Information security policy is best disseminated in a comprehensive security education, training, and awareness (SETA) program. A security awareness program is one of the least frequently implemented but most beneficial programs in an organization. A security awareness program is designed to keep information security at the forefront of users’ minds.</li>
<li>Several published information security frameworks by government organizations, private organizations, and professional societies supply information on best practices for their members.</li>
<li>One of the foundations of security architectures is the layered implementation of security. This layered approach is referred to as defense in depth.</li>
</ul>
