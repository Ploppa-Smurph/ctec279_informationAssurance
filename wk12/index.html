<h2>11.06 Module Review</h2>
    <h3>11.06a Module Summary</h3>
    - Information security should be implemented in every major system. One approach is to ensure that security is a part of the organization’s system development methodology. DevOps and SecDevOps are emerging accelerated development models that merge development and operational skills.
    - Software assurance is a methodological approach to the development of software that seeks to build security into the development life cycle rather than address it at later stages.
    - The implementation phase of the security systems development life cycle involves modifying the configuration and operation of the organization’s information systems to make them more secure. Such changes include those to procedures, people, hardware, software, and data. During the implementation phase, the organization translates its blueprint for information security into a concrete project plan.
    - Before developing a project plan, management should articulate and coordinate the organization’s information security vision and objectives with the involved communities of interest.
    - The major steps in executing the project plan are planning the project, supervising tasks and action steps within the plan, and wrapping up the plan.
    - Each organization determines its own project management methodology for IT and information security projects. Whenever possible, an organization’s information security projects should be in line with its project management practices.
    - Planning for the implementation phase involves the creation of a detailed project plan. The project plan can be created by using a simple planning tool such as the work breakdown structure (WBS). The plan can be prepared with a simple desktop PC spreadsheet program or with more complex project management software. The WBS involves addressing major project tasks and their related attributes, including the following:
    - Work to be accomplished (activities and deliverables)
    - Individual employees or skill sets assigned to perform the task
    - Start and end dates for the task, when known
    - Amount of effort required for completion, in hours or days
    - Estimated capital expenses for the task
    - Estimated noncapital expenses for the task
    - Identification of task interdependencies
    - Constraints and considerations should be addressed when developing the project plan. Considerations include those for finances, procurement, priority, time and scheduling, staffing, scope, organizational feasibility, training and indoctrination, change control, and technology governance.
    - Organizations usually designate a professional project manager to lead a security information project. Alternatively, some organizations designate a champion from a senior level of general management or a senior IT manager, such as the CIO.
    - Once a project is under way, it can be managed to completion using a process known as a negative feedback loop or cybernetic loop. This process involves measuring variances from the project plan and then taking corrective action when needed.
    - As the components of the new security system are planned, provisions must be made for the changeover from the previous method of performing a task to the new method(s). The four common conversion strategies for performing this changeover are as follows:
        - Direct changeover
        - Phased implementation
        - Pilot implementation
        - Parallel operations
    - The bull’s-eye model is a proven method for prioritizing a program of complex change. Using this method, the project manager can address issues from the general to the specific and focus on systematic solutions instead of individual problems.
    - When the expense and time required to develop an effective information security program is beyond the reach of an organization, it should outsource the program to competent professional services.
    - Technology governance is a complex process that an organization uses to manage the impacts and costs of technology implementation, innovation, and obsolescence.
    - The change control process is a method that medium-sized and large organizations use to deal with the impact of technical change on their operations.
    - As with any project, certain aspects of change must be addressed. In any major project, the prospect of moving from the familiar to the unfamiliar can cause employees to resist change, consciously or unconsciously.
